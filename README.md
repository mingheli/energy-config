The user should be able to enter the number of each device they want, and your UI should show the price, land dimension required and the sites energy density

- Assume that for every 4 industrial batteries bought 1 transformer is needed.
  
- The UI should also have an autogenerated layout showing an arrangement of batteries based on the userâ€™s configuration

- The site layouts be able to configured and not exceed 100ft

Addtional feature:
